                    <p>My work is rooted in emotion—raw, layered, sometimes chaotic, sometimes flooded with light.
				 Like life itself.<br>

				Over the years, I have developed my own technique through layers of watercolor and acrylic on cotton paper.
				 I aim to give form to what cannot be put into words: the complexity of being human, of being alive,
				  and all the nuances in between : what would emotions look like if they were leaked onto paper?<br>

				I experience the world with heightened sensitivity, almost as a form of synesthesia. Music becomes color,
				 texture, atmosphere—something otherworldly. But it is not only music. Everything reaches me in waves and
				  layers. This is the space I paint from—and the space I invite you into.
				   Not to understand or decode, but to feel. To absorb. To allow each painting to remain fluid, shifting,
				    uncertain, alive. Never the same the longer we look at it.<br>

				I am constantly chasing light—both visually and symbolically. I am drawn to violets, blues, yellows,
				 and pinks—colors that carry as much joy as pain. They are the colors of happiness, but also of physical
				  bruises, of impact on the skin, on our being. These are the colors of healing after shock.<br>

				In October 2020, following the Beirut port explosion, I left Lebanon for Paris, carrying the weight of that
				 violence—and the clarity it brought. We survived. Now we have to live. In the aftermath of such rupture,
				  an irresistible desire emerges: to run towards what restores light to the soul. My earliest memory of
				   happiness is the feeling of paint in my hands. And since I could not figure out who I wanted to be,
				    I decided to become myself.<br>

				A self-taught painter. Since childhood, my senses have been hypersensitive, constantly stimulated by the world
				 around me—colors, sounds, smells, people. These ordinary things make life both devastating and extraordinary.
				  Through watercolor and acrylic, I try to capture these fleeting, precious moments and transform them into a
				   visual narration of emotion.<br>

				Each painting begins with an emotional charge. I work in layers, pushing the paper close to its breaking point,
				 testing how much it can hold. Pigment pours onto the surface, and I pour myself into it. I step back.
				  I return. I allow chaos to settle, carving form from what remains. The process is instinctive and
				   intimate—a reflection of what it means to be human.<br>

				Studio Émotions is both a physical space and a state of being. I aim to open a space where multiple truths
				 can coexist. We all perceive the world through what we have received. My hope is that somewhere within
				  these layers, you recognize a fragment of your own story.<br>
