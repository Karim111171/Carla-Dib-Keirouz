                    <p>My work is rooted in emotion — raw, layered, sometimes chaotic, sometimes full of light. Through watercolor and mixed media on 450g cotton paper, I try to give shape to the unspoken: the fragile beauty, the sorrow, the contradictions of being human, of being alive.

I experience the world with heightened sensitivity — maybe even a form of synesthesia. Music doesn’t just move me; it becomes color, texture, atmosphere- other worldly . But it's not only sound. Everything comes to me in waves and  layers: overlapping feelings, sensory fragments, invisible truths. That’s the space I paint from — and invite you into. Not to understand or decode, but to feel. To absorb. To let each piece be what it is: fluid, shifting, uncertain, alive.

Light is a recurring thread in my work — not only the visual kind, but symbolic too. I often paint with deep violets, electric blues, and warm yellows. They hold joy, but also pain. These are the colors of bruises after impact.

In October 2020, after the Beirut port explosion, I moved to Paris. I carried with me the weight of that violence — and the clarity it brought. we survived , now we have to live,  I felt an urgent pull to follow the things that bring light to the soul. And in that search, something clicked: since I couldn't figure out who I wanted to be ; i decided to become myself. 

I’m a self-taught painter. Since childhood, I’ve absorbed life through emotion and sensation — colors, atmospheres, silences. My work honors those fleeting impressions. The quiet, often overlooked moments that make life so devastating and beautiful at once.

Each painting begins with an emotional charge — a memory, a sound, a single feeling. I work in layers, pushing the paper almost to its breaking point, as if testing how much it can hold. Watercolors pour onto the surface and I pour myself into them. Then I step back. I return. I try to carve form from the mess. It’s instinctive, intimate — a process that mirrors what it means to be human.

Studio  Emotions is both a space and a state of being. A place where emotion, memory, and color can coexist freely. I’m not here to offer answers. I’m here to open a space where multiple truths can live together — because they already do. We all see the world differently, shaped by what we’ve received in childhood, in society, in silence. My hope is that somewhere in these layers, you find a piece of your own story.</p>
